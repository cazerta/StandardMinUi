# StandardMinUi
Small tweaks using the standar Blizzard UI - such as:
* Scaling down the Main Menu Bar [at the bottom]
* Setting Main Menu alpha to 70%
* Increasing Player and Target frames size in 10%
* Repositioning of the Player and Target Frames
* Hides 'Objective Tracker' when in Raid; shows it otherwise
